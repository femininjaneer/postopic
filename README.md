# Welcome to PosTopic

## An application to learn Javascript technologies

The purpose of the application is to add topics, and posts those topic. You can also share links to the application, so people can see that specific topic or post

This is a work in progress.

This application uses:

Server-side:
 - NodeJS
 - ExpressJS
 - Jade Templating
 - AsyncJS
 - MongoDB
 - Mongoose

Client-side:
 - RequireJS
 - BackboneJS
 - Lo-Dash
 - jQuery
 - Bootstrap

This is a very simple project, and the TODO.txt gives you an idea of what still needs to be done for the application to finally be finished.
