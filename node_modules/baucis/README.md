baucis v0.4.7
===============

Baucis is Express middleware that creates configurable REST APIs using Mongoose schemata.

Like Baucis and Philemon of old, this library provides REST to the weary traveler.  The goal is to create a JSON REST API for Mongoose & Express that matches as closely as possible the richness and versatility of the [HTTP 1.1 protocol](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html).

Those versions published to npm represent release versions.  Those versions not published to npm are development releases.

Relase versions of baucis can be considered stable.  Baucis uses [semver](http://semver.org).

Please report issues on GitHub if bugs are encountered.

Usage
-----

To install:

    npm install baucis

An example of creating a REST API from a couple Mongoose schemata:

    var Vegetable = new mongoose.Schema({
      name: String
    });

    var Fruit = new mongoose.Schema({
      name: String
    });

    // Note that Mongoose middleware will be executed as usual
    Vegetable.pre('save', function () { ... });

    // Register the schemata
    mongoose.model('vegetable', Vegetable);
    mongoose.model('fruit', Fruit);

    // Create the API routes
    baucis.rest({
      singular: 'vegetable',
    });

    baucis.rest({
      singular: 'fruit'
    });

    // Create the app and listen for API requests
    var app = express();
    app.use('/api/v1', baucis());
    app.listen(80);

Later, make requests:

| HTTP Verb     | /vegetables   | /vegetables/:id |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| GET           | Get all or a subset of documents | Get the addressed document |
| POST          | Creates new documents and sends them back.  You may post a single document or an array of documents.      | n/a |
| PUT           | n/a | Update the addressed document |
| DELETE        | Delete all or a subset of documents | Delete the addressed object |

HTTP Headers
------------

| Header Field | Notes |
| ------------ | ----- |
| ETag | Supported out-of-the-box by Express. |
| Last-Modified | Can be set automatically by Baucis.  Pass `lastModified: 'foo'` to `baucis.rest` in order to set the path to be used (currently it must be a `Date`). GET requests to the collection set this to the latest date out of all documents returned by the query.
| Accept | Set to `application/json`  for all responses. |
| Allow | Set automatically, correctly removing HTTP verbs when those verbs have been disabled by e.g. passing `put: false` to `baucis.rest`. |
| Location | Set for PUT and POST responses. |
| Link | If `relations: true` is passed to `baucis.rest`, this header will be set with various related links for all responses. |


Examples
--------

 * [Examples with Backbone](examples/Backbone.js)
 * [Examples with jQuery](examples/jQuery.js)

Query Options
-------------

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| conditions | Set the Mongoose query's `find` or `remove` arguments |
| skip | Don't send the first *n* matched documents in the response |
| limit | Limit the response document count to *n* |
| select | Set which fields should be selected for response documents |
| sort | Sort response documents by the given criteria.  `sort: 'foo -bar'`' sorts the collection by `foo` in ascending order, then by `bar` in descending order. |
| populate | Set which fields should be populated for response documents.  See the Mongoose [population documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) for more information. |

It is not permitted to use the `select` query option or the `select` option of `populate` with a `+path`.  This is to allow a mechanism for hiding fields from client software.

You can deselect paths in the schema definition using `select: false` or in the controller options using `select: '-foo'` and your server middleware will able to select these fields as usual using `query.select`, while preventing the client from selecting the field.

`bacuis.rest`
-------------

Use plain old Connect/Express middleware, including pre-existing modules like `passport`.  For example, set the `all` option to add middleware to be called before all the model's API routes.

    baucis.rest({
      singular: 'vegetable',
      all: function (request, response, next) {
        if (request.isAuthenticated()) return next();
        return response.send(401);
      }
    });

Or, set some middleware for specific HTTP verbs or disable verbs completely:

    baucis.rest({
      singular: 'vegetable',
      get: [middleware1, middleware2],
      post: middleware3,
      del: false,
      put: false
    });

`baucis.rest` returns an instance of the controller created to handle the schema's API routes.

    var controller = baucis.rest({ ... });

Controllers are Express apps; they may be used as such.

    var controller = baucis.rest({
      singular: 'robot',
      configure: function (controller) {
        // Add middleware before all other rotues in the controller
        controller.use(express.cookieParser());
      }
    });

    // Add middleware after default controller routes
    controller.use(function () { ... });
    controller.set('some option name', 'value');
    controller.listen(3000);

Controller Options
------------------

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| singular | The name of the schema, as registered with `mongoose.model`. |
| plural | This will be set automatically using the `lingo` module, but may be overridden by passing it into `baucis.rest`.
| basePath | Defaults to `/`.  Used for embedding a controller in another conroller. |
| publish | Set to `false` to not publish the controller's endpoints when `baucis()` is called. |
| select | Select or deselect fields for all queries |
| findBy | Use another field besides `_id` for entity queries. |
| lastModified | Set the `Last-Modified` HTTP header useing the given field.  Currently this field must be a `Date`. |
| restrict | Alter the query based on request parameters. |
| configure | Add middleware to the controller before generated paths. |

    var subcontroller = baucis.rest({
      singular: 'bar',
      basePath: '/:fooId/bars',
      publish: false,
      select: 'foo +bar -password',
      findBy: 'baz',
      lastModified: 'modifiedDate',
      restrict: function (query, request) {
        // Only retrieve bars that are children of the given foo
        query.where('parent', request.params.fooId);
      }
    });

    var controller = baucis.rest({
      singular: 'foo',
      configure: function (controller) {
        // Embed the subcontroller at /foos/:fooId/bars
        controller.use(subcontroller);

        // Embed arbitrary middleware at /foos/qux
        controller.use('/qux', function (request, response, next) {
          // Do something coolâ€¦
          next();
        });
      }
    });
