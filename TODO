Bugs
 - The create templates are not rendering. Need to fix this. >_<

New Features
 - Add ability to edit and delete topics and posts from the client-side.
    - Delete: Access the model thru the PostView, destroy it, redirect to the homepage
    - Edit: Open the create template with all fields pre-filled with data from the model that is being edited. When submit is clicked, or enter is pressed, Backbone will get the data from the form and save it.

Upkeep/Implementation:
 - KEEP MAKING IT LOOK PRETTY~!
 - Clean up custom.css
 - Refactor MainRoute.js. Particularly at getData()
 - Make templates consistent.
